One such tool was to employ Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Font matching, as well as Color Separation on an image. OCR and Color Separation was only implemented in this case. I worked on the OCR part, while one of my other colleague worked on Color Separation. I also contributed to the development of the frontend application.</p>\
            <p> Despite only being an MVP, it was a great learning experience to be able integrate image processing techniques into our web application. The solution in the end was not a perfect one and had lots of room for improvement, but this project succeeded in attracting new clients to our company.</p>',

            <p>There is also another platform that powers the site called <a href="https://www.mopress.io/">MOPress</a>, that enables news publishers to source content from a group of users known as freelance mobile journalists (MOJOs). We develop lots of features and enhancements for it too. One of the major features that I helped to develop was a gamification system for the MOJOs, whereby each of them is assigned a rank based on how much articles they write and the number of pageviews they are getting from each article. As they increase in rank, they are entitled to receive more credits on the platform which they can withdraw as cash. This is to incentivize them to create more quality news content.</p>\
